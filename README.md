# Remaining Tasks (In order of Priority)
## Layout
### General Functionality
- Basic page
    - Help
- Transitions
- Optimizations
  - Speed: Can be rather slow and unpredictable. When finished, remove unnecessary libraries
  - Mobile optimization
    - Get stylings for sizes
    - PWA
### Styling
- Simple parallax
## Sections
### Homepage
- Add black Youtooz model.
- Items to be added:
  - Sections:
  -- Hobbies
  --- Spiderman
  -- Machine Learning
  --- Neural Implicit Representations
  ---- Stable Diffusion: recreating image from text while modeling directly on implicit neural fields in order to synthesize new data requires a slightly different take on signed distance fields, so
  this model uses diffusion probabilistic fields
  ---- Nerf:
  ---- 3D Gaussian Splatting: Technically it's not a neural implicit representation, as it doesn't make inferences during rendering. But it fits the best here with the other models.
  --- Computer Vision
  ---- Lyft
  -- Visualization
  --- Election: TODO: Upgrade d3.js to visx.js
  --- Uber viz
## 3D Models
### Animations
- Spiderman
## Flask
- change index.py file to __init__.py with manifest file
- Create blueprint for template
- add launch script to run gunicorn and config wsgi.py file to allow testing without external dependencies
## Splash
## Deployment
